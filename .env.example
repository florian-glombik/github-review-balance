# Project state to filter PRs by (e.g., "Ready for Review" from GitHub Projects board)

# If a PR is in multiple projects, ANY matching state will include the PR
# Leave empty or comment out to disable project state filtering
# REQUIRED_PROJECT_STATE='Ready for Review'

# Specific project number to check for project state (optional optimization)
# Example: For https://github.com/orgs/ls1intum/projects/2, use:
# REQUIRED_PROJECT_NUMBER=2
# This makes project state fetching faster by only checking one specific project
# Leave empty to check all projects the PR is in

# Example: MAX_REVIEW_COUNT_THRESHOLD=2 will hide PRs with 2+ reviews (unless you were requested)
MAX_REVIEW_COUNT_THRESHOLD=6

# Filter out users who have not opened any PRs (default: false)
# When enabled, only shows users who have opened PRs in the review balance table
# This is useful to focus on users you can "give back" reviews to
# Set to true, 1, or yes to enable filtering
FILTER_NON_PR_AUTHORS=true

# Exclude generated files from line count calculations (default: false)
# When enabled, automatically generated files (e.g., package-lock.json, yarn.lock, *.min.js)
# are excluded from the additions/deletions counts in PR statistics
# This gives a more accurate view of actual code changes
